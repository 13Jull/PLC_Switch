# Power Line Communication (PLC) for domotics

My final project as an Electronic Engineer during my university years. I had the opportunity to work on a Power Line Communication module, specifically designed to enhance connectivity in smart house ecosystems and overcome the limitations of WiFi connections. All the information is uploaded for the functional prototype shown below.
